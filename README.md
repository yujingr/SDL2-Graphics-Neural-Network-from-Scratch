# Neural Network from Scratch in SDL2 (2020)

## Description

Uses simple (processed) 10x10 pixel images of handwritten digits as input, and trains a neural network (uses fully connected deep network and not CNN due to simplicity) to recognize them. Training performed in python, and the trained weights are imported into the C++ program.

By clicking on individual pixels, you can draw a digit. The neural network will then predict the digit and show intermediate layer weights and activations. And finally, the predicted digit will be shown.

Supports keyboard shortcuts for viewing the weights and activations of the intermediate layers, layer by layer.
